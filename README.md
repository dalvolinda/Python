This project draws inspiration from a real-world meal delivery service, incorporating fundamental programming concepts such as dictionaries, string manipulation, modules, functions, lists, loops, and exception handling. It emphasizes structured and easily accessible information representation while highlighting the value of ternary operators for concise, efficient decision-making in a single line. This approach enhances code readability, optimizes performance, and simplifies maintenance. Additionally, best practices are reinforced through the use of docstrings, which provide clear documentation within functions, making them more understandable for developers. The project includes essential features like restaurant registration, listing, status updates, and an option to exit the application.
