In this project related to restaurant review, object-oriented concepts such as class, instance attributes, methods, and constructor are introduced. The special methods that Python generates when a class is created are covered, as well as custom methods, object creation, and a deeper understanding of object-oriented programming. Classes are also modularized for use in other files. Python file classes are imported, such as the Restaurant class, which is imported by the main file (app.py), allowing the program to use its functionalities. Best practices are also addressed using a docstring tool.
