Through FastAPI, the concept of APIs and their role as a bridge between different systems - allowing communication and data sharing - are explored, as outlined below:
- Installing the FastAPI library and setting up an environment to create an API using Python;
- Creating an endpoint with FastAPI to provide resources related to restaurants, enabling users to access specific information about these establishments;
- Adding an endpoint that accepts a query parameter to filter restaurants based on their names, offering a flexible way to search for specific information;
- Using docstrings to automatically generate documentation in FastAPI, making it easier to understand available endpoints and allowing direct testing within the documentation interface.
